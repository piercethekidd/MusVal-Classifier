4,8687,"Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh a holiday)

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a bad day (ah)
Had a bad day (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

6,8689,"Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it
Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin ya' name
But you're driving me crazy, the way you're making me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more"
7,8690,"My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yeah, she caught my eye, as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel, with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

No fighting, no fighting

No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

I'm on tonight, you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche Baila en la calle de día

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
Cómo se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah, she's so sexy every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie

There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo and so much space
And when you're out there without care, yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some

We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum

40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all!""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dog

You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue

If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry

The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school

Blew every dollar that we ever made

Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me not to feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?""

Where'd you go? I miss you so

Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I'm I planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?""

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so

I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (love)
My love (love)
My love (love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (love)
My love (love)

(Look at that bitch, shit – hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we-

We finna have a party (Turn the music up!)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt!)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole

You're comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy – and his boy, and his girl

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together
Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)
Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days

If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It had been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cannot do this on my own
I am letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I am on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I am sorry for the way
I have been living my life
I know I have got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cannot do this on my own

And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey

See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind


And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

In my own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart, and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thang
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thang
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's piling boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're saying, ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing—

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thang

The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! — ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes; that's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thang
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thang

Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and chocking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lotta weed but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, Eightball and MJG
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy

In sickness and in health for rich poor and I stay rich

600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait

And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?


Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in yo' chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in yo' dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo' neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet

I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh

Eminem is rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bo and all marvelous them rollin'
Women just hoein', big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be all in them and throwin' D
Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style like whee
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

I feel you creepin'
I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me

This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply:

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Saying ""I do"") — because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team?
(Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure
(That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for
(Just say I do) — because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I., they call me Candle Guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my
Vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back {""Like this""}
 w/ ad libs

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back
 w/ ad libs

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(So what you need?)
I’ll need a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

‘Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny ’cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

I’m gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

With the latest dictionary and today’s who’s who
They’ll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody’s got a drug dealer on speed dial
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I’m gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I’ll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don’t get ‘em wrong

While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

They say we stand for nothing and

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

We just know that the fight isn't fair

Now understand why I take my time
Cause you come with alibis
Tryna get me to see that's where you tryna be
But I don't want your man!
Your man's been callin me, tryna get me to see
That he wants me to be with him
But he ain't the one for meeeee
And if you only knew (only knew)
You would, do what you had to
Finally see that (finally get the chance to see that)
You need to get if he don't wanna
LOVE you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he..
WHERE HE WANNA BEEE, YEAH-HEAA

Uh, uh, uh
Here's a little lesson, Lil' Kim don't stress 'em
Kick 'em all straight to the curb like Beckham
Broke wit my ex, he with her for now
But little do she know, she's just a rebound (HEEY!)
Callin my phone, she's so outta pocket
I been there before ol' girl, you need to stop it
When he's with you, he's wishin it was me
You might be where he's at, but I'm where he wanna be Baby, BAY-BAY!

If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it goooo
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it goooo
If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it goooo
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should

Think of it every second, I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I’m gon' get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try, but my obsession won't let me leave

You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

I've tried so hard
I can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I've tried so hard
But will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault, ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong
And again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane, chasin' my dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded, tryin' to erase it
But I just can't, ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

I've tried so hard
I can't seem to get away from misery

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game
But I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away from the ones
That say they love me the most
How could I create the distance
When it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know, but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man I'm slippin', can't lose my balance
I'm tryin' not to panic

I've tried so hard
I can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I've tried so hard

Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out, it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it – no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard, but I won't pull through

I've tried so hard
I can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I've tried so hard
But will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault, ‘cause I

161,8845,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

But what am I gonna say, when you make me feel this way

Wherever you go, I always know

I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know

It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots

I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexable
Professional, drinkin' X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them—

Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her—

Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know

Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)

EXTERIOR ESTABLISHMENT SHOT, MONARCH BAY, CALIFORNIA 1977
“Well, when the President does it
“That means it’s not illegal.”
“Nixon Admits to David Frost
“On Watergate: I was Illegal Eagle”
INTERIOR YAHOO GLOBAL NEWS ANCHOR KATIE COURIC’S PRISON CELL, (THE FUTURE)
Every President since has double-crossed
Why we had a hunchback for a boss
Read the red-headlines today
Don’t know what-the-F-word they say -
North Korea-SONY fender-bender
A never-ender
“Bush Sr. Hypno’d John ‘Warlock’ Hinckley
“Sirhan-Sirhan Squeaky-Frommed Huntley-Brinkley”
Now we’re stuck wit’ McCartney crinkley
INT. MIND OF THAT BLACK ACTOR WHATSISNAME, TOM HANKS(?), IN “THE GREEN MILE”
Hope they let Katie outta Colonel Klinkly
Girl tunnel out through a colonoscopic wormhole
Like Stephen King caught in a Mexicali sauce mole
Now that we a FEMA-Masonic State, we all in Stalag Oswald
CAMERA GLIDES THROUGH CELL BARS, ENTERS MIND OF KATIE COURIC THROUGH HER EAR
Irgun Masons JDL Mossad
Not on No-Fly torture-terror list
Just Arab Muslims Nuns an’ they “marionettes,”
Xmas firestorms out of Santa’s Ana
Mud-slide quake robo-reported
Beverly Pills got it distorted
“Brad buys Malta for his Alter’
“Takes a pop at Ratso”
Equal to NK leak
“Oprah’s a fatso!”
“Where Is Crash McKlintock?”
Op Ed piece The New York Titty
Two-page spread bangin’ Mayor Shitty
K J-un gon’ nun-chuk yo

The “Carpet Eater” crunches Sony numbers
No it’s Cos’ in trouble
One-to-Three at Tahatchapee
OJ murders Jew and a woman
“The glove didn’t fit”
Then admits it - go fig’
Landis manslaughters Viet children
Gets off with a wrist-slap acquit, craven
Jean Harris murders, out in five-to-seven
N.O.W. busts her out by illegal pardon
Stealberg’s good with “ET” obese chilled-dren

Islam AK-47’s assault and peppered
Satirical poobahs at Charlie Hebdo

CUT TO: PROSPERO AT PUCK BUILDING, MANHATTAN, (mid-1980’s)
Full-fathom-five my blather lies
Those were pearls that were my jibes
Like a Low Mar Squid left by eventide
Up to his collar at Deptford’s change of sides
Collapsed, that bridge in Chaucer’s Reeve’s Tale
By the slim weight of Heath bereft of ale
Sent down, and we’re still paying
The fat rub-cheeked black dye-crowned publican
Isaac Butt Home Rule Famine turned from Orangeman
Dye made of squid’s ink from Tristram Shandy Ireland
Widow Bull’s pub grub quidditch after a neap moon paen
Poor Marlowe, too, marooned by prayerless Spy
And twelve moons twice over, Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy
Put on, put off, life’s invite at last in infant’s humid grasp -
Our last breath reduced to rude analogy
In a vinegary obit’ estuary
And so I erred again into life
Like an actress born unto the stage
Without a script or reading page
White as a ski slope’s end of an age
The long wordless tumble into red Vanisha grave
My kingdom was quick divided among my fry
James M. at SNL given status as Chief Sea Leech
Mike L., Horseshoe Crab of Grease, Algae, Acid Beach
And what of Maximum Pross, what’s he to toot?
He must give his Mira on the wall the boot
Gamel too must have his way, camel seahorse
With switched sons in a sea ‘roo’s too soon rued pouch
Laugh-drunk and far off course
His shame slid out without a nurse
And gunsel-smooth sadder Kurt
His hustler image thirty years out from his last flirt
With Gemini-born King Mark, divided my royal mind
T’wixt “Brothers” evil whilst I languish here in a land
Quite too medieval
Am I become Ambassador to Paris? speak of the Neville left to wine
And mutton, else, what?, - passing gas without embarrass
What Queen in the House of Etheridge would fain leave her genius
With an hidalgo come to, at mejor, nada, nothingo
Sarco-vagus, he has some nerve, misty e-cigarettes “zee” view
Fascist Le Pens whose cold ink pool marines the dew
And their Elvish King a simple Flemish ass?
Puck-Arielle, fetch me Sandy Caliban
Spy’s Gregg “Seth” Killday, the “Celia Brady” peach
And your “herbed” companions from Long Island
Quahog and Patchogue and Ronkonkama
Do not forget Asserie Azoth chefs cordon bleu
Wolfgang, Duxbeak, Kinky Trailer Guitar, and have a care
Ratzass be there with his friend Michael Caine
Alert Nasty, Brutish and also Tall and Short
To our predicament, have Ole and Axel call on Abort Talk
“Stalin in high-heels,” and all those inducted
Into the Odor of Meritorious Tatler
By Merle Auberon’s Blondissimus Doomkriegfrau
The Blonde Iraqi (just a teensy brown)
Editor of VF plays Cher for Maples Marla
Then Cher for Ronnie Chasen both of “Burlesque”
(The blonde “lead”ing the blonde)
She let her membership in humanity lapse
While I, Prospero, left on a traffic island, Berlin Alexanderplatz’d
Her excuse, “After the Gulf War crisis, brunette trumps blonde,”
Has Tina come to this? Burnt P. J. O’Cork for Annie Bleepowitz
Though they’re thick as dweebs
Gemini Femini Frumpy Liebowitz
Or that Diana autodafebiography
(Lie detectors fail to confederate her fantasy)
What a mess Rudolf Hess “The American Friend”
MacArthur planned to invade turf Canadian
So the Brits to sleep they pretended
While England Slept the U.S. crept
Into King Henry the Fowler’s fine bird nets
And we must invite Robert Gottlieb
Who killed John Kennedy
Toole, instead promoted Adope Heller
Toole brinked to suicide, Bob a di-putz fella
Assimilated simulated see ya later Uri Geller
Another two feet on the thinning ledge
“Too much of this so its blurring that”
Power tie blue-striped shirt
“Too much of shit so its blurring shat”
Poor Bob missed the fleur-de-lis on JKT’s post
The number 3, Bob didn’t see it’s the G
The 33 Degree, preferred Heller’s 22 skid-doo
And Ian Jack of Granta’s NZ Freemasonic coup
When one has The Book of Codes, one sees
What’s next, dear Puck, a statue of your putti-shaking-pee
From a ledge, drunk Puck teetering over a howling Houston Street?
Or some unsteady poet cleaning windshields
With a TV critic’s scribblings in the Times
On a TV movie based on a Chester Himes
At the same time pissing poteen from the wolf’s tooth
At Donovan’s farm off the craggy cliff
At Bantry in an August-blustery Samhain
IRA bomb took out Mountbatten for his Elmer Gantry
(Fake name stolen by Essex in lost Wessex)

Surtout à St.-Mandé), General Munro (Fifth Column) tweets
“Korben Dallas cannot meet defeat.”
Seat The Wizard of Gettysburg beside Diane von Furstenberg
Have her whip-wounds treated by the Asian Dr. Who
With a Tincture of Dishonesty, she the first in iceberg preserved
Till it splits in two to spill her out as fashion’s goo
Post-thrown-garter tarentellas, throw her to the fellas
In the mosh pit writhing with totalitarian twits
While Farnham Charlestons, X-arm-kneed, on the mantelpiece
(Boston’s famed balloonist McSorley’s somehow missed)
And tell Last, “Butt not Least,”
Still, sit Last beside the Beast
Western Freedom’s just a stone’s throw away
In the Battle of Plataea a Spartan threw a stone
Hit the Persian general square on his dome
Mardonius killed, Greek general Pausanias rushed in
It all ended Persian-badly at the river of Asopus
And today, radical Greeks hope to ass-soap us
That being sad, we’ll have the ball end badly
Invite the 29 duels of Alexander Pushkin
All fought over slight Olga Larina
The last ball has Pushkin “ballerina”
Beneath a cherry tree, shot as one of Russia’s “superfluous men”
Oblomov’d by “herstory” on a couch by Rudderless Tipling
Or some such author perilously Chekhovian, -
Yes, uninvite Kurt Kreamer-Andersen
Speaking of ladies and their lapdogs
Why not dig up Edie Sedgewick
“End Badly” Andy, who love-killed her
Let her die, stole her style
Later got shot by the gal he defiled
(After Sister or Sor Juana, Solanas and “Waltzing Mathilda,”
Valerie’s Carboard Andy “waltzing” after a “Mighty Battle”)
Andy’s Capri pants Aldo Mori’d in a cookie jar
Robin Williams’ watches cower in an argyle sock
Because Coluche, his avatar, by a truck got smacked
La Moto Braque’d under a Michelin track
Viva, Bike Boy left a Basquiat case
At last Valerie Jean Solanas’ SCUM Manifesto
Promotes the eradication of all men from “Her” planeto
No more Manhattan “co-managers of the shit-pile!”
No now it will be Womyn-hat-on, celeb runway style
No more men’s vulgar ejaculations, “neat-o!” or “Sieg heil!”
Our Jean Val-Jean Stars in “I Shot Andy Warhol,” with Ultra-Violet
Cicciolina avec des pneus, Alessandra Mussolini, Tippi Hedren’s lion
2Pac a Pepper’s Ghost at Coachella goat-shaped Plantation golfing
With Bafomet Google Map and Joe Dallesandro rapper dauphin -
Buried cold in Warhol’s vault behind his Factory face
CUT TO: PROSPERO’S DAYDREAM INTER-LEWD
Walking home the Senator spies Maura
Dancing in the Tivoli fountain
With her clothes on, but with Abadon
What does it mean this shrewd “abandon”?
“The Republican Senator from Israel a Paragon”
That Act should be repealed
I don’t recall voting for that schlemiel
The Senate needs a final face peel
Getting old, this act, this “nation.”
Civilization and this hypocrisy it’s based on
Civilization debases, one man left on
Side’s retired, so much for the bastion
Inning over outing over bring home the caissons
From Baghdad from Helmland and from Khe Sanh
CLOSE: PROSPERO’S FACE AS HE SNAPS OUT OF HIS DAYDREAM
Oh! and do inviteVanity Fair ‘s King Gray Dung Carter
Shoveling dungster-loving Epstein, he’s quite a Bart-erer
Jeff frees up steins as skulls do minds
Yes, – all heads lose their minds, at the last --
Yes, yes, Puck-Arielle, let these pages be the modest stage I’ve set
A snapping, dancing firestorm balletic in its burnt ham wit
Served to inane dunces slit by the Sphinx’s dagger solar ambit
They say in Tanzania chimpanzees have firedancers
Better than our straitjacket flits. Poor Lord Peter Apnea
Thought himself a spider, left without a web -
Let fly, - and in his fall a nation’s necromantic fancy
Blossoming black wisp readings of Wills left intestate
With us to suck the squirt of Hecate’s next pressed breast leak
Harried by autumnal colors, lightning lapels bespoke fraternity
Yet touched us to the quick at Chappaquiddick
That season I lost someone to a double game of quidditch
While Henley ‘scaped us through starry windows with fair Eternity
Abiding now in the gossamer of Winehouse Algol Mugwump
Shall we as a nation hew it, this Jamestown starve’s dream of London
With binge-purge Diane and too-poignant Ferguson
In Sloane Square encompassed by a Bafomet’s cussing
As misery would have it in a bear’s paw fern or pelican’s ladle
The fish that flipped out like a tired dredl
Or Jeffrey who clawed his way to the top
To steal it from toddlers wearing bonnets
With no St. Lou’ as ludique guide, no arch Spencer-ian sonnet
No Wainwright Building’s bullet window to kill an Eric
Errant like that vile girl of Metz “burnt at the stake,”
Unhorsed by violent bowman, rein, spit and bloody bit
Yes, cowslip-anthem, mercurial blood-bubble Puck
Twin of Arielle of Dumbassle, make thee hence and fly the coop
Let stars rue your rooster flight to subtle cups
Drunk as a deep dish from a shallow river’s death
And brought thereby to edgy heath, Elizabeth’d
By tickling Seymour and stand-offish Parr
Alice through Elizabeth’s The Mirror
Or the Sinful Soul, (“KP” on embroidered cover
With KAPHR for nations conquered perhaps meaning “KAFFIR”)
Her gown nevertheless cut to tatters left in clover
Like luckless Seymour when his head did shatter
Bloody scalp and ensign pulver’d
Thusly Puck and quickly, act the peduncle to the stigma born
Steady your eager stamen in conundral ether for the Virgin Queen
Crowned by her one Corona in a painting by Nicolas Poussin
Ants shall mark thy anther-dusted path far as Karlsruhe’s
Nighttime inflorescence, there to find Lord Strange
With Cistercian plotters minting finskies, Daphneange
Miranda and Sabrina Guinness, Sylvie Boucsasse
And J. “Bottom” Wildenstein, ivresse at last embraced
“Midsummer Night’s Merde” or Dream defaced
Well! a toast of dew, off you fly with curt adieu, -
And have a care you post bail for Clare’s Irby’s
Bangalore arrest!
But as you fly this atmosphere goodbye
Like poor Branson after his meteoric hayrick fire
Bring back the Demon not some Sasquatch
Fear Caliban, and keep a watch
Recall that Ariel-Caliban anagrams
Aréole BAL I CAN
Or Ari El Bal Icon
Or BAL(L) (EYE) I CAN
PRO-SPEAR-O (“eye” in Hebrew)
Or the Free Masons’ sign
Medieval mother AERIAL PEL-I-CAN
That plucks its AUREOLES  to feed its clan
Or something worse, perhaps a soul
Some dark whisper from the diary of Elias Ashmole
BAL IN A Aréole, yes, ball in an aureole!
Elizabeth’s head pox-scarred, bewigged, half-bald
Soprano to Doubting Tom, “in our coy tuss’, interruptus.”
Be Ronnie chastened by this verse, Puck-Arielle
At Karlsruhe Institute there you’ll meet BHL
The greatest mind of the International Date Line
Ovule go then on this Venetian-Marlovian mission
Don’t spend too much time with my double
Poor Marlowe in the city that is sinking
Pollen is the reason we’re all made gay superstitions
So dally not with masquerados
You must return by way of Carl’s rue
Cormaic’s Wain as it was called by Gaels and Britons
Grab this wheeling Big Dipper by its “Hold de Grail” queue
Below your merry round you’ll hear bad German
“Kartoffeln statt Döner” (“Potatoes Not Kebob!”)
Yet potatoes were brought to Karlsruhe by Spanish ensigns
(You’ll find in that land fantasticated aphorisms)
Alas, there is no time to entertain such aphid notions
Here’s a pence, then, stop off for something stöllen
And as we live between lives in no time thrice
From tottering sots to tots on trikes
Here’s the two-fold universe’s one-time back-rent –

CLOSE ON PROSPERO POURING GOLDEN SAND THROUGH PUCK’S OPEN FINGERS BY STRANGE MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO THE SORCEROR AND HIS APPRENTICE
For as Zippy the Pinhead
Will someday steal from Prospero’s fishnet

“The Kids in the Hall Are Alright
“But we can’t pay them crikey’s blight.”
Such a tune it was, such an air
Yet why Carter Burwell’s Carla Bruni laugh
When I told ‘im John Lennon got sacrificial calfed?
Payback fo’ “Don’t trust anyone under 30,”
Jack N’s porcine white nostrils filthy-dirty
Or aristocratic gaffe?
Puck, I am a’feared
Last night I saw a mean white cat
Creeping in poplar moonlight
Four X’s ‘cross its back
What is da meanin’ of dat?
Cat-meaning finds its own resolve
We must seek the Universal Salve
Babylon’s Enkidu lies gored by the Bull of Heaven
We hunt a rare rough poultice to thickly armor
Prospero in the gown of Gilgamesh
And, but still, Puck, maybe we should pistol
Way past Bristol
To da Tao of da 19heaventies
For these times suck
We could get laid by da Marchesa Casati
Or Isabella Blow, meet up wit’ Rakehell
Or Weedkiller, da reverend’s Dom Perignon
Make out wit’ da wardens of Lower Orkney
Bed down wit’ naked moles munchin’ chaplains’ organs
Federico Garcia Lorca them in an Andalusian ditch
While Baron Munchausen shoots a buck wit’ cherry pips
Or Puck, how bout’ dis –
Afghan women in da Second Anglo-Afghan War
Into captured soldiers mouths they drowned em wit’ their piss
We could do some dat water-boardin’ wit’ da trolls of CIA-ISIS
If they insist
Dear, drear Caliban, while I sympathize
With your plight, a virgin at age 1,098
Unlike the first woman President of the H. Lampoon
Who won, they say, by a manslide
We must not despair, off to the 19heaventies
We must fly, to the Heavenly Music Corporation
We must not tarry in your prurient imagination

US-Europe da hippo sent to Crete
CUT TO: ISLAND OF CRETE, AFTERNOON OF THE FAUN, A HIP-HOP LULLABYE, YET SOMEHOW PERTINENT TO PRESIDENTS
The hippo sent to Crete
Denied it was a creature
Because it sported human features
When questioned at Cretan customs
It scraped and lowed and mooed and bowed
To the customary doubts
Employed the usual nostrums
It japed and booed and soiled and howled
But turned back once, turned back twice
The poor hippo was turned back thrice!
Mr. Customs in his uniform so fine
Wondered aloud if hippos could be humankind
“Do you have a sparkle in your eye
“And a waltz inside your feet?”
“I can gargle, and I’m very good at sleep!”
“Can you fiddle
“Nail-bite nibble
“Do you even think?
“I can dribble
“I’m all middle
“And occasionally I blink!”
Turned back each time and much less nice
Nothing worked, not even hippo spice!
“Can you sing
“Do you speak Twaddle
“Can you cook while reading books?”
“I can swim
“I can waddle
“I can fish without a hook!”
“It takes more than that!
“YOU’RE JUST A MONSTER IN A HAT!”
Finally, and with a voice KA-BOOMING
The hippo on two legs stood there LOOMING
“I AM NOT A CREATURE!
“I’VE GOT HUMAN FEATURES!”
The tired Customs man glared
Then stared and stared and stared
He did not care
Like a Duchess made of ice
He wasn’t very nice
Then suddenly Mr. Customs
Stamped the hipposterous passport
Shouting to two tubby assistants
Who’d fallen asleep in their drool
(Two little guppies had snuck in
To swim inside their nostrils
Till the assistants felt a double-trouble tickle
Ending with a sudden sneeze of fishy trickle
The guppies didn’t want to tumble
Into just anybody’s middles!
They safely hopped away into a barracuda’s muzzle
The assistants snapped awake
Blinked and waddled
Through their nasal muddle
To gape at a hippo on two feet with a hat
Standing there quite befuddled
As Mr. Customs shouted with a great big snort
“Let him through the back door quick!
“Like you two Cretans claiming to be human
“HE’S A HIPPO CRETE!”
Whoa-oh Whoa-oh Woah-oh
They comin’ afta lames

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

But what am I gonna say, when you make me feel this way
I just...mmmm

And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time
Now holding me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go

Wherever you go, I always know
Cause you make me smile even just for a while"

Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze

Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away

Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty

Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'

The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh but I'm taking them back

I'm gonna smile ’cause I deserve to

Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings

Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it

Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low

And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face
As the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient
Waiting

We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused
And got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours
Would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world
But no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where
And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face
As the door keeps slamming

It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
(When you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

We take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen

And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""

And, oh, you ain't know? She get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

It's a rap when she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)
Gotta get that feta like a boss tycoon (It's a rap)
Now hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)
Now you can Google, download to iTunes
See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin'
Bet she got them heads turnin'
You gon' hear it clack-clack when them heels get to burnin'
Stiletto so fuego, she got her own label
And got us all doin' her tomato

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

Shawty got looks and shawty got class
Shawty got hips and shawty got ass
When she hit the stage, she drop it down low like
Ay, this is crazy, it's amazing
She must be the one, the lady

She moves her body like a cyclone

Going hard when they turn the spotlights on

286,8971,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone

Can't you see that there's nothing that I want to do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
And nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right

And it feels like tonight

Just when I leave, I'm back for more

In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

Can't you see that there's nothing that I want to do
But try to make it up to you

306,8991,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you"

People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home

We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster

And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad

I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door

Ay... this a special what's happenin to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin at what you ain't got
Start bein thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin and the hollerin, back and forth with the arguin
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

Got everybody watchin what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin your paper, and keep on climbin
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin (shinin)
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin my life, my liiiife
And I'll never stop it

Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

Or the girl who never wants to be alone

Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

Ah, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

Ah, the night is calling?
And it whispers to me softly come and play
Ah, I am falling
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe
Up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain
Inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself - SOBER!
Coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
Looking for myself - SOBER!

'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had

Broken down in agony just trying to find a friend

How it feels to love a girl

When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her

And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left is good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday, 7 takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I-I can't t...
I can't take it any longer

Slipping through our fingers

That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears

352,9037,"This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like déja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough (cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me, oh

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there

Sweep the streets I used to own

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind

You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone

And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it

Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody

Just something about the way she move
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her
Said, ooh, there's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you

There's something about her

Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss

Ooh there's something about
The kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her
There's something oh so sexy about
The kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it, no doubt
There's something about her

Cause she work like a boss, play like a boss
Car and a crib, she 'bout to pay them both off
And her bills are paid on time
She's made for a boss, only a boss
Anything less she's telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

She got her own thing

Her favorite thing to say: ""Don't worry, I got it""
And everything she got: best believe she bought it
She gonna steal my heart, ain't no doubt about it
Girl, you're everything I need
Said you're everything I need

She got her own thing

361,9046,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack

'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams"
362,9047,"I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

364,9049,"I practiced this for hours, gon' round and round
And now i think that I've got it all down
And as i say it louder, I love how it sounds
Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
Yeah, you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise
It came out like a river once i let it out
When i thought that I wouldn't know how
Held on to it forever just pushing it down
Felt to good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons, shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
There's Nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul here to say
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise
Our favorite place that we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise
If i could see the future and how this plays out
I bet its better than where we are now
But after going through this its easier to see the reason why
Its no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
Yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise
The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories (our memories)
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep (you can't keep)
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise"
384,9070,"I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then


I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then

And I thought I loved you then"

S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (awuu)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men
I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline
In case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (ungh!)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (awuu)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Everything I ever ever seen in a model
If you leaving baby don't leave me until tomorrow
Tonight we gonna get a little tipsy with a bottle
You gonna get me up, I'm gone take 'em down
I'm gone change my ways, we gon' work it out
Girl, I wouldn't be the same if you were with somebody else
Girl, it wouldn't be the same if I were with somebody else
I know, I made, mistakes, before
Promise, you won't, get hurt, no more
I got, what you, like and, you know
Once you lay down, it's on


Why you wanna leave me, you should wanna tease me
Being icy ain't easy, I make it look easy

371,9056,"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?

Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles


See, I know what I'mma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag

Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my drink and smoke my weed

Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise you naked

Woke up today, and all I could say is, um


Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um yea, of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'til the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is



Now if everybody would please
Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me

381,9067,"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy

And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife


When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable"

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

Yo, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes

I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now

Somebody, take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?

Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me when it comes to love
You're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Falls perfectly without her trying

When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

Let's spend it up (let's spend it up)
Go out and smash it  (Smash it)

Jump out that sofa, (Come on!)

Fill up my cup, (drank!)

Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (for what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything, ha ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up Oprah? Ha ha)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)

424,9110,"""Yeah, it's been a ride. I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one. Now some of you might still be in that place. If you're tryin' to get out, just follow me, I'll get you there.""

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole Universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was—ehh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cadence
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

445,9132,"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now
(Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (see it now)"

I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me -- go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" -- they trying to clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this

Falling for betrayal is worse

How to love, how to love

Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out

You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together

Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck
Or get struck like lightnin’, fighters keep fightin’
Put your lighters up! Point them skyward, uh!
Had a dream I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin’ feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I’ll be the fuckin’ illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I’m refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up’s using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I’m a cocky prick
But you cocks are slick, poppin’ shit
On how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid?
Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite: you stayed the same
‘Cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell them shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I’ll probably already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, because—

This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
It's funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is

It’s dark, let me turn on the lights

Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!

You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as

And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll

On my birthday you sang me ""Heart of Gold""
With a guitar humming and a no clothes

'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...

(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about

How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December...

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets

Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon

Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between

Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good

They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down

In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it doesn't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition isn't ever going to go away

Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Never felt so high

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel better"

Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for

Eat her 'til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses

Talking 'bout everything under the moon

When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop

622,9312,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

Tryna find a hella taste

That's how it should be done

Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

635,9325,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever
Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture
So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation
While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

636,9326,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one, the one, the one
Oh, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away"
638,9328,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
""I'm on Fire"" and ""Born to Run""
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Ooohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio

We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm  not over you

Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

No matter what I say I'm not over you

You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

Appreciate every mixtape your friends make

I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa

I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita

You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight

Spin the globe, whatever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we’re Barcelona bound

Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on

And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts

Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out of my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

Take you to every party

But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Could not help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let us go get this thing stuck""

Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell I cannot get you out of my head

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it

I was afraid of the dark

And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing"

I got it hooked, ‘cause she seen me in a suit
With the red tie tied up

Make sense, don't it?
Now make dollars, I mean billions
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
This street is what schooled him
And made him slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated, like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it

738,9428,"When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it


And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

This city never sleeps at night

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell

Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib

No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd; totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I fill on you, I'm sayin'...

Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me 20 dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game, like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""

Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it

I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya

She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it

Crumbling like pastries

Or sells love to another man

For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!

Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on!

The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now


Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

No one's ever gonna stop us now"

If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too

I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

Send ""Lost In Your Complexity"" Ringtone to Mobile I'd give you the soul of this boy that is in front of you
His useless life isn't enough to beseech all your love
As you put sight in this poor boy that is ready with fear
To flourish through darkness and enter your complexity
Aching as flowers refused
Then you loose grip on emotions;
With sadness we're doomed
The frost is inside you killing you through
Burning your heart in the name of truth
In fear, we sear
Again in tears
Recall the years when fights appeared
Remember dear, those lonely years
You turn, with fear, to not see me crying here
Why? Why does your sun shine this way?
Say no more, cast me to die just today
Fighting within
Our quest tastes like an open wound
Now that's all over; this quest will never come through
I can't wait for any answers
I'm so lost to go any further
Man might never know for sure
The complex equations of love and truth
(So) face the abnormal strength within you
Just when you loose the chance to choose

A hundred jewels between teeth

The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

Same old empty feeling in your heart

But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made

Though this is all for you I don't want to hide the truth

She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broken inside
The story of my life

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, now
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between

To keep her warm

I spend her love
Until she's broken inside

Is like chasing the clouds

You are the sun, the glowing halo

Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play

Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""

Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón (Me palpita lento el corazón)
Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando (Bailando)

Llenando el vacìo
Subiendo y bajando (Subiendo y bajando)
Bailando (Bailando)
Bailando (Bailando)
Ese fuego por dentro
Me está enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

Con tu física y tu química
También tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila
Y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)

Con esta melodía
Tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía
Mi cabeza está vacía
Y ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo mas)

Yo quiero estar contigo
Vivir contigo
Bailar contigo
Tener contigo una noche loca (Una noche loca)
Y besar tu boca (Y besar tu boca)
Yo quiero estar contigo
Vivir contigo
Bailar contigo
Tener contigo una noche loca
Con tremenda nota

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Tú me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión (Estoy en otra dimension)
Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón (Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón)
Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte
Abrazarte y sentir la magia de tu olor

847,9537,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload

Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (dirt)

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to

Thugga Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle, knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, and I'll do her, I want her head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day
I'm skatin', like that nigga Lupe
Aye, I'm on the top just like toupee
Aye, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste

I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like a beginner and this is only beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'

Sitting in the middle of this ocean, Pacific that is
You understand me? Bunch of bad bitches, ya heard?
Popping that GTV, living that lifestyle, ya heard?
I do this for Ms. Gladys, boy - 100"

869,9559,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

To move to a place so far away

The minute that my left hand meets your waist

Put my finger on your tongue

I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6

Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey

We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together

All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying ""come on he ain’t worth the pain""
""Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
Cause tonight it’s all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

I’m feeling that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m coming in hot

What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around

Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human

Part 2: Partition


Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh baby baby we betta slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me

The kinda girl you like

Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

Oh there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh baby baby be sweating out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discotheque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest since she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, “You're holding back”
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”
Ohh, c'mon girl

Deep in her eyes, I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, you're holding back
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance
Don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”
”Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”
”Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”"

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'cause, darling, I'm a nightmare
Dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't, warn ya

Watch her do a dance then it get me in the game

Complimenting my style you're flyer with the Captain of the team
Now move, right, right there, hit reverse girl and back that rear
Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shorty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

I will scream them loud tonight

Starting right now I'll be strong

A lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me

And it's been two years

She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

I know my rent was gon' be late bout a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Oooh!!  I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

Tonight I'mma lose my mind
Better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
Party every night, like my last
Mami know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drawwwwp
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

I know my rent was gon' be late bout a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club

Hey, let's get it now

Oooh!!  I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

So you might as well you roll it up
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
I said, everybody gone through something
(Everybody’s gone through something)
Said, everybody gone through something

Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Yeah, let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

951,9641,"Finding good music can be a challenge. With summer now  upon us I decided to compile a playlist (if you will) of a majority of songs that I feel set a hype or positive vibe and that can be expressed almost anywhere. Obviously songs labeled explicit may have some swearing (some may have a lot) but overall get things bumpin'
Music here spans a variety of genres that come from many artists I personally admire. Hope you give some of these a listen to and have a great time wherever you may play them!

He's so bad, but he does it so well

Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again

Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa

You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants

Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go

No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants"

I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye

Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided

If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram

It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah

I am convinced I'm the only one left

Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled

A Montessori

987,9677,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely

Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old

I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me

We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold

You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes

But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
And I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here

I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go

It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
'Til the day I die

Always be by my side, 'til the day I die

Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
‘Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind?

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side

No where to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the Woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
Run run Lost Boy, they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

1092,9783,"It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1093,9784,"I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you, from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Baby, I'm perfect for you

And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, we're perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
